**Machine Learning Model Deployment for Loan Status Prediction**

In recent years, machine learning has become an indispensable tool for financial institutions, particularly in the area of loan management. The ability to predict loan outcomes, such as whether a loan will be fully paid off or go into collection, is critical for minimizing risk and making informed lending decisions. However, deploying machine learning models in a user-friendly and accessible manner remains a significant challenge, especially for non-technical users who may not have the expertise to interact directly with complex algorithms.
This project addresses the problem by developing a web-based application that allows users to upload loan datasets and select from a variety of machine learning models to predict loan status outcomes. The models available for selection include a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and Logistic Regression. The application processes the data, applies the selected model, and outputs key performance metrics such as F1-score and accuracy. This solution aims to bridge the gap between machine learning model development and practical, real-world application by providing a simple, intuitive interface for end-users. 

**Objectives**

**User-Friendly Interface**: Designing a web-based platform that is visually appealing and easy to navigate, enabling users to interact with machine learning models without needing to understand the underlying code or algorithms.

**Model Selection and Deployment**: Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms that can be selected dynamically, allowing users to choose the best model for their specific dataset and needs.

**Real-Time Performance Evaluation**: Providing immediate feedback on model performance using metrics like F1-score and accuracy, helping users understand the effectiveness of the models applied.

**Scalability and Flexibility**: Ensuring the application is scalable, with the potential to integrate additional models or functionalities in the future, and flexible enough to handle various types of input data.
